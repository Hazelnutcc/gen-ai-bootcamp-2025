## facts
- CHAT-GPT is part of a dynamic architecture rather than a single static model
- OpenAI doesn't officially disclose the exact parameter count for GPT-4, but itâ€™s known to have significantly more than the 175 billion parameters used in GPT-3.
- It runs with optimizations that may involve multiple models or subsystems working together for better efficiency and performance in various tasks.
- Its architecture adapts to support multimodal inputs and generate complex outputs based on various tools like code execution and web searches.
