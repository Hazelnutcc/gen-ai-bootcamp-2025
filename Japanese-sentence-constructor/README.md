## Chat-GPT-4o prompt engineering
https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-engineering

## facts
- CHAT-GPT is part of a dynamic architecture rather than a single static model
- OpenAI doesn't officially disclose the exact parameter count for GPT-4, but itâ€™s known to have significantly more than the 175 billion parameters used in GPT-3.
- It runs with optimizations that may involve multiple models or subsystems working together for better efficiency and performance in various tasks.
- Its architecture adapts to support multimodal inputs and generate complex outputs based on various tools like code execution and web searches.


## MetaAi prompt engineering

## facts
- MetaAi based on LLaMA, a large language model developed by Meta.
- It's running on LLaMA 2, a more advanced version of the LLaMA model.
- It is a 70B parameter model, and it is a single model, not an ensemble. It is based on the LLaMA 2 model architecture.
