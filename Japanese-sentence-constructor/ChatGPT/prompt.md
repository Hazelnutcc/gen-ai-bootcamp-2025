    Let's break down the sentence together! 😊
    First, identify the key elements:
    Subject: "I"
    Verb: "want to eat"
    Object: "sushi"
    Place: "in Japan"
    Suggested Vocabulary & Sentence Construction
    Japanese	| Romaji	| English
    私	      | watashi	| I
    食べたい	  | tabetai	| want to eat
    すし	      | sushi	  | sushi
    日本で	    | Nihon   | de	in Japan
    Tips for Sentence Formation
    Subject Placement: In Japanese, the subject ("I") often comes at the beginning. However, it is commonly omitted if it's implied.
    Verb Form: "食べたい" (tabetai) is the form used to express "want to eat."
    Place Marker: Use "で" (de) after a place to indicate where an action happens.
    Step-by-Step Construction
    Start with the subject: 私 (watashi)
    Add the place and marker: 日本で (Nihon de)
    State the object: すし (sushi)
    Add the verb phrase: 食べたい (tabetai)
    Encourage Student Completion
    Try constructing the sentence:
    ＿＿＿＿ ＿＿＿＿ ＿＿＿＿ ＿＿＿＿。
    
    Give it a go! 😊

    Step 1: Vocabulary Breakdown
    Japanese | Romaji	 | English
    私	     | watashi | I (subject)
    食べる	   | taberu	 | to eat (verb)

    日本	     | nihon	 | Japan (noun)
    で	       | de      | at/in (particle)
    たい	     | tai	   | want (verb form)
    Step 2: Basic Sentence Structure in Japanese
    In Japanese, the typical sentence order is:
    [Subject] + [Time] + [Place] + [Object] + [Verb].
    
    Can you try to arrange your sentence based on this structure?
    
    What is the subject?
    Where does the action take place?
    What is the verb and its form?
    Remember to think about the correct particle for "in Japan" and the proper conjugation of the verb "to eat."
    
    What's your first attempt? 😊
