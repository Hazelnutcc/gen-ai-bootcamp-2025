The purpose of this architecture is to guide stakeholders through 
the technical landscape of GenAI without prescribing specific solutions.

## Users Interation: 
This provides the interface for instance Website / APIs / Chatbots, etc 
through which users input queries and receive AI-generated output and 
responses, ensuring accessibility and instant user engagement.

## AI Models:
This hosts and manages large language models (LLMs) such as Chat-GPT, 
Meta AI, Claude, deepseek, etc or Vertex AI, AWS SageMaker, performing 
inference and generating outputs based on user inputs.

## Integration:
This serves as the communication hub between frontend and 
backend components, utilizing APIs,message brokers, and middleware 
to manage data flow and AI interactions.

## Data Storage & Data Pipelines:
This includes data storage, processing pipelines, and governance 
mechanisms that support the data ingestion and transformation 
of both structured and unstructured data.

## Infrastructure - Compute & Networking Resources:
This provides compute resources, networking components, 
and security measures essential for hosting AI services and ensuring 
system scalability. For example, cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP).
