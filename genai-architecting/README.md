## Scenario: Implementing GenAI for Customer Support Automation

## Business Requirements:
This is a growing technology company, wants to enhance its customer support operations by integrating GenAI. The objective is to deploy an intelligent virtual assistant that reduces support ticket volume by 50% while maintaining customer satisfaction.

  ## Functional Requirements:
  Real-time text-based responses to customer queries
  Personalized recommendations based on customer profiles
  Ability to handle at least 10,000 simultaneous customer interactions
  
  ## Non-Functional Requirements:
  Performance: Low-latency responses within 2 seconds
  Scalability: Support for 10x growth in user base during peak periods
  Security: Role-based access control and data encryption
  Usability: Intuitive interface for non-technical customer support agents
  
  ## Tooling:
  GenAI vs. ML Decision:
  GenAI: Deployed for text understanding and response generation
  Traditional ML: Used for routing tickets and analyzing common support issues
  
## Risks
Performance Risk: Model inference latency might degrade with large concurrent requests.
Security Risk: Customer data breaches if integration is not secure.
Vendor Lock-In Risk: Dependence on a single cloud provider for model hosting.
Bias Risk: AI-generated responses may unintentionally show biases.

## Assumptions
The customer data provided for training is accurate and comprehensive.
Cloud services will have high availability with minimal downtime.
Models used will be upgradable for new features without significant disruption.

## Constraints
Budget Constraint: Must stay within a $500,000 infrastructure and deployment budget annually.
Infrastructure Constraint: Limited on-premises hardware; cloud-based solutions are preferred.
